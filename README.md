# Portfilio

This is my portfolio that showcases my skills and applications in front-end,back-end, and full-stack web-development. I designed this portfolio for future employers and users with detailed descriptions of my abilities and accomplishments. This application provides the user with easy access to this information and prevents timely research into the different aspects provided in my portfolio. This application helped me learn about my own journey to becoming a proffesional web-developer.
